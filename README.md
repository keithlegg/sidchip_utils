# sidchip_utils


If you ever get the chance to but 30 rusty old SID chips from an engineer who worked at commodore. 

DONT. It will haunt you for years. 

I did however. Straight from the legendary Dave Haynie.

This is my collection of tools, references files, and errata making thos old chips sing.

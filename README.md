If you ever get the chance to purchase 30 rusty old SID chips from an engineer who worked at Commodore .... 

DONT! 

It will haunt you for years. I did however. Straight from the legendary Dave Haynie.

This is my collection of tools, references files, and errata making those old chips sing.

What it is:

    siduino - Kicad project / Gerbers 
              A one off PCB design thats an arduino (atmega328p) that has a SID chip on it 
              technically you could program it with the arduino tools if you mapped the pins out properly, but I havent tried
              it has a 12V and 5V power bus to satisfy the analog-y power needs of the old chips. They run HOT. 
    
    siduino firmwware - AVR firmware 
   
    sidcom       - 

    python tools -
